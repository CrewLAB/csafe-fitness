# CSAFE Fitness Library

This is a dart library that implements the [CSAFE Protocol Framework](https://web.archive.org/web/20071207110624/http://www.fitlinxx.com/CSAFE/Framework.htm) used by fitness machines.

Variations on this protocol are known to be used by the following fitness machine manufacturers:
- Concept2

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

TODO: Include short and useful examples for package users. Add longer examples
to `/example` folder. 

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Vocabulary

Where possible, this library tries to re-use language from the CSAFE specification.

One notable exception to this is that this library will use the term "server" instead of "slave" to represent the fitness device providing the data and the term "client" instead of "master" to represent the device that is requesting the data.
